# Stage F — Acceptance Tracker (evidence-bound Claude analyst)

Honest status as of 2026-07-16. **Stage F is IN PROGRESS — not complete.** The hardest, most uncertain parts (real
API characterization + the adapter/analysis engine) are DONE and LIVE-PROVEN; workflow/Telegram integration and the
conversational agent are BUILT-OUT partially / NOT YET wired. This tracker is the single source of truth for what is
proven vs pending, so the next session can continue without re-deriving anything.

## DONE + PROVEN

| Item | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Disk blocker resolved | root was 100% (0 free); brute-force SSH log flood (btmp/auth/syslog) truncated + journal capped → **782 MB free**; n8n + prod containers healthy, healthz ok |
| Real API characterized | 21 bounded live probes → `docs/STAGE_F_API_CAPABILITY_MATRIX.md`. Gateway = Claude-Code-wrapped proxy; thinking always on; **tool_choice:auto is the only reliable structured transport**; native structured output & max_tokens ignored; count_tokens works; 401/400/timeout mapped |
| Canonical adapter | `n8n/lib/claude_adapter.js` — buildToolRequest / parseClaudeResponse (tool_use extraction, text-JSON fallback) / classifyClaudeError / callClaude (bounded transient-only retry) |
| Contracts + validators | `n8n/lib/claude_contracts.js` — versioned analysis/candidate/synthesis schemas + tools; validateStructured + validateEvidenceIds (no-invention gate) |
| Evidence package | `n8n/lib/evidence_package.js` — bounded, deduped, PII-scrubbed, current-vs-historical, hashed |
| Cost | `n8n/lib/llm_cost.js` — actual-usage cost + conservative estimate |
| Analysis orchestration | `n8n/lib/claude_analysis.js` — build → call → validate → ONE repair → deterministic fallback (fail-closed) |
| Offline tests | `tests/test_stage_f_core.js` — 77 checks; full `make test` ALL SUITES PASS ($0) |
| **LIVE single-source analysis** | real endpoint, real autolombardn1.ru evidence, request_id `448ee09a`: tool_use, **a real model error (`text_ю` Cyrillic key) caught by local validation → ONE bounded repair → success, no fallback**, 10307 in / 2139 out tokens, **$0.063**, 90 s, Russian output, 15 evidence-grounded items with fact/inference/recommendation separated, confidence 90 |
| Pre-F test hardening | 3 pre-existing time-bomb fixtures (fixed 2026-06-15 dates aged past WF10's 30-day window / WF14 recency band) re-anchored relative to now: wf10-source-health, lineage-e2e, lead_scout WF14 triage |

## NOT DONE (remaining Stage F work — for the next session)

| Item | Notes |
|---|---|
| **Workflow integration** | The analysis engine is not yet called from any n8n workflow. Plan: a canonical **WF28 — Claude Analyst** callable workflow, or an enrichment branch in WF20's report path: [Build Evidence Package (Code)] → [HTTP Request (Claude cred `OEen8Vl1tdWtv7v4`, 90 s timeout, retryOnFail)] → [Parse+Validate (Code)] → IF invalid → [Build Repair]→[HTTP]→[Parse2] → merge. Fixed 2-call max topology (no loop). |
| **Report/XLSX integration** | Merge Claude insights into the WF12 report + XLSX under «Подтверждённые факты / Аналитические выводы / Рекомендации / Доказательства и ограничения»; deterministic report/XLSX must still ship if the LLM fails. |
| **Multi-source synthesis** | Schema+tool exist (`ccSynthesisTool`); orchestration + wiring not built. |
| **Candidate enrichment** | Schema+tool exist (`ccCandidateTool`); top-3–5 gating + wiring not built. |
| **Public lead interpretation** | Not built. |
| **Conversational analyst agent** | `analyst_agent` / `analyst_tools` libs not built. CodeVinci AI Pilot identity + read-only tool selection + approval-gated mutations + bounded loop. |
| **llm_telemetry + Sheets tab** | Persist schema/prompt version, model, package hash, tokens, cache, repair, cost per call. Sheets contract tab not added. |
| **Feature-flag rollout** | MS_ENABLE_LLM_ANALYSIS / _SUMMARY / DISCOVERY_LLM_ENRICHMENT / ANALYST_AGENT gates (default OFF) not wired to the new path. |
| **Live scenario matrix (§14)** | Only #1 (website analysis) proven. TG/VK/synthesis/enrichment/no-data/max-token/refusal/conversational/reuse pending. |
| ~~Pre-F debt B4 / B6 / B7~~ | **DONE (session 53)** — B4 plan-fingerprint dedup (live-proven, efe0daf), B6 requested-source terminal status (00bc4bf), B7 Russian XLSX + hidden technical sheet (e67ece1). All deployed; `make test` ALL SUITES PASS. |
| **Prompt hardening (repair↓)** | The one live repair was a Cyrillic `text_ю` key — add an explicit "use the ASCII English keys exactly; no visually-similar Cyrillic in keys" instruction to CA_SYSTEM_PROMPT before rollout. |
| **Runbook** | `docs/STAGE_F_RUNBOOK.md`. |

## Measured repair/cost stats (live so far)

- Live analysis calls: **1 scenario, 2 API calls** (1 primary + 1 repair).
- JSON-syntax repairs: **0** (tool_use returns a JSON object — structural, never a syntax repair).
- Schema/evidence repairs: **1** (the `text_ю` key), repair success **1/1**.
- Fallbacks: **0** live (fallback path proven in unit tests).
- Cost: $0.063 for the one live analysis; ~$0.01–0.03 expected per single-source call once evidence packages are tighter.

**Stage F.5 must NOT start** — Stage F is not complete.
